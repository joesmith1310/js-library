        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <div class='anchor' id='examplesStart'></div>
        <div class='generalDescription'>TeamViewer.js is a javascript library that allows the developer to 
            display sports team information in various formats. TeamViewer.js consists of three main visual components; 
            'FormationView', 'RosterView' and 'PlayerForm'. 'FormationView' is the most feature-rich part of the library, 
            it allows the user to view members of a sports team as nodes on a field. 'RosterView' allows 
            the user to see the members of the sports team in list format. 'PlayerForm' is a form that allows the 
            user to add players to either of these views. A 'TeamViewer' represents 
            a single group of players, it is what links all of the visual components together. Any components 
            linked to the same 'TeamViewer' represent the same 
            player group. The developer is able to choose the level 
            of interaction the user has with each of these components and customise them individually. Potential use cases
            and the varying levels of user interaction are exampled below.

            <div class='splitView'>
                <div class="splitViewDescription">
                    In the most basic use case, TeamViewer can be used to display
                    teams that the developer has already defined. The developer can 
                    disable any user interaction with the TeamViewer components.

                <div class="splitViewExample">
                    <h4>FormationView</h4>
                    <div class="tv-formation-view viewer1"></div>
                    <h4>RosterView</h4>
                    <div class="tv-roster-view viewer1"></div>
                </div>

        <div class='section'>
            <div class='anchor' id='example1p2'></div>
            <h3>Loading From JSON</h3>
            <div class='splitView'>
                <div class="splitViewExample">
                    <h4>FormationView</h4>
                    <div class="tv-formation-view viewer1"></div>
                </div>
                <div class="splitViewDescription">
                    An alternative way of displaying pre defined teams is using JSON.
                    'FormationViews' can be converted to JSON strings and loaded at a later time. This means it 
                    is possible for the developer to create a 'FormationView' in a private 
                    page of the app where they have access to the edit functionality. The developer can then save 
                    the 'FormationView' and load it to a public page on the web app where edit functionality is 
                    disabled.

            <h3>Interactive Nodes</h3>
            <div class='splitView'>
                <div class="splitViewDescription">
                    The next level of user interaction sees the user able to click on nodes 
                    to expand them and reveal more information about the players. 
                    Notice this example features a substitutes list; a sub-component of 'FormationView' 
                    which allows the user to see all the players who are in the squad, but not in 
                    starting team. The nodes in this substitutes list are also expandable. Another thing 
                    demonstrated here is the devloper's ability to change the orientation of the 
                    'FormationView'.

            <h3>Fully Editable Formations</h3>
            <div class='splitView'>
                <div class="splitViewExample">
                    <div class="tv-formation-view viewer2"></div>
                </div>
                <div class="splitViewDescription">
                    With all user interactions enabled the user is able to fully customise a 'FormationView'.
                    Notice how the developer has the ability to change theme of the component and how this 
                    'FormationView' is representing a different set of players for a different sport.<br><br>
                    This example introduces the concept of frames. The user is able to add a new frame which can 
                    be likened to starting a new page in a book. The user's previous pages are stored and can 
                    be cycled through and edited after a new page has been added.<br><br>The user can make the 
                    following edits to a frame:<br><br>1) Click the 'draw' button to enter drawing mode. This allows 
                    the user to click two points on the view which will be connected by a colored arrow.<br><br>2) 
                    Click the 'Annotate' button to enter annotate mode. The user can click a location on the frame 
                    to add a comment. Press enter to finalise.
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class='splitView'>
                <div class="splitViewDescription">
                    3) Click the bidirectional arrow icon to enter 
                    move player mode. This allows the user to drag and drop nodes to new positions, allowing them to 
                    create custom formations.<br><br>
                    4) Click the plus button to add a new frame. Note this is a completely separate instance 
                    of the FormationView so edits made to this frame are not applied to the rest of the frame 
                    stack.<br><br>5) Click the curly arrow to cycle through frames the user has created.<br><br>6) If no 
                    mode is selected, the default functionality is players can be swicthed when they are dragged 
                    and dropped over eachother. <br><br>Try 
                    using the formation view above to create new frames, edit them and cycle through them.

            <h3>Adding and Removing Players</h3>
            <div class='splitView'>
                <div class="splitViewExample">
                    <div class="tv-player-form viewer3"></div>
                    <div class="tv-formation-view viewer3"></div>
                    <div class="tv-roster-view viewer3"></div>
                </div>
                <div class="splitViewDescription">
                    Here a new component of TeamViewer is introduced; the 'PlayerForm'. This can be used to add new players 
                    to an exisiting team list. <br><br>As well as this it is possible to remove players from a team by clicking 
                    remove in the 'RosterView' player entry or clicking remove in the expanded pitch node. The component 
                    must have the 'editable' user interaction enabled to display these remove buttons.<br><br>
                    The key thing to note here is that multiple views can be used to represent the same group of players, 
                    if a player is removed it is removed from all components connected to that group of players.

                <div class="splitViewDescription">
                    Auto cycling is a feature that allows the developer to automatically cycle through a sequence of 
                    'FormationView' frames. An example of where this can be useful is when the developer wishes to 
                    player movements over the course of a came or training session.
