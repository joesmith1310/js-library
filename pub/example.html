        This is an example webpage that uses the TeamViewer library. This is a use case where the developer has created one team viewer i.e. only one group of players is being represented, but they have instantiated two formation views for this team. This allows the user to visualise two formations at the same time.
        The target user of web apps like this could be sports coaches who want to plan before training sessions or a game.
        <br><br>Try clicking on a player node to expand their information. Drag and drop player nodes to swap them around. Drag nodes over to the substitues bench to make a subtitution. You can also add to the group of players being represented using the add player form. Change the sport and see how this affects the number of players on the field 
        and the formations that are available to you. Change the formation to see how the nodes rearrange themselves. When you expand a node you can remove the player from the group.<br><br>Note that you can't exchange players across formation views as each player should be shown exactly once in each view.<br><br>
        See below another example using the library. This time different functions have been used to customise the appearance of the FormationView and the formation itself. Notice this time a PlayerForm was not used so in this use case the user does not have the option to add their own custom players.
        See the example.js file to see which functions have been used and how these have affected appearance and functionality.
